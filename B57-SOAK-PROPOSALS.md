# B57 Soak — Proposals & Improvements (review with Ray in the AM)

**This is the LIVE proposal log for the B57 24h Chernarus soak.**
It is a running accumulator written by the automated soak-report agents
(`WaspB57Expansive`, every 4h; `WaspB57Full`, daily 06:00) plus any manual notes.
It is **propose-only**: nothing here is deployed. Review it with Ray in the morning
and promote the agreed items into real work.

**Build under soak:** `[55-2hc]warfarev2_073v48co_b57.chernarus` — a just-shipped AI-commander
overhaul: larger groups via founding-pad, 10 teams/side, take-towns / push-front behaviour,
slot reorder, marker fix, and a paced economy.

**Conventions**
- Every entry is **dated** (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`) and **tagged** `[idea]` (concept only) or
  `[draft-coded]` (draft code committed on `claude/b57-soak-proposals`).
- English only. A2-OA 1.64 constraints apply to all draft code: no A3-only commands
  (no `isEqualType`/`isEqualTo`), no sim/distance-gating of AI, never a frozen/standing-still
  AI, do not touch antistack.
- New entries are **appended** under the relevant section (newest at the bottom of each section).

## AI Commander improvements
<!-- spearhead/target selection, team founding & sizing, posture, economy pacing, push-front logic.
     Each entry: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [idea]|[draft-coded] — finding -> proposed change. -->

- 2026-06-20 11:55 [draft-coded] — **Found-size decoupled from the live MIN floor.** RPT/impressions
  show founding works (`B57 padded infantry team to floor (8 units)`) yet measured `unitsPerTeam` sits
  at **4.2–5.1**, below the 8–12 target band. Root cause (confirmed in `AI_Commander_Teams.sqf:278-298`
  comment): HC-founded teams are **never refilled after founding** (`AI_Commander_Produce` skips
  `wfbe_aicom_hc` teams = 100% of live teams). So founding *at* the floor (8) guarantees the live
  average dribbles *below* the band the instant attrition starts. Draft: new constant
  `WFBE_C_AICOM_TEAM_FOUND_SIZE = 10` (`Init_CommonConstants.sqf:229-237`), and pad to it (clamped to
  [MIN,MAX]) in `AI_Commander_Teams.sqf:283-303`. Identical behaviour when FOUND_SIZE==MIN.
  **Economy caveat:** ~25% bigger founds cost ~25% more supply under `SUPPLY_INCOME_MULT=0.35`; may
  slow team count slightly — review with Ray before deploy.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Reinforcement / top-up pass is the *real* fix** for the dribble; found-size
  is only a stopgop. A founding pad can never hold a high live average without refill. Proposal: a slow,
  cheap commander pass that, for each HC team below e.g. `0.6 * WFBE_C_AICOM_TEAM_SIZE_MIN` that is NOT
  in active contact and is near a friendly supply source, dispatches a top-up of `Man` class units to
  the HC owning that team (reuse the `delegate-aicom-team` / CreateTeam path with an "append units" verb,
  charged from commander funds). A2-OA-safe: no sim/distance-gating of the team itself, no antistack
  touch, `isKindOf`/`getNumber` type checks only. Must throttle (1 team/tick) to avoid a town-activation
  spike like the old per-group HC pick (`Server_DelegateAITownHeadless.sqf:22-28`).
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Posture read at warm-up looked good but is coarse.** Impressions: WEST=DEFEND
  / EAST=PRESS then both HOLD after each held 1 town; EAST strength climbed 82→101 while WEST stayed 64.
  Strength asymmetry persisted without WEST switching to a strike/reactive posture. Proposal: when own
  strength trails enemy by > X% for N consecutive ticks AND a reachable enemy spearhead exists, bias WEST
  toward `PRESS`/reactive-defense earlier rather than camping DEFEND (`AI_Commander_Strategy.sqf` posture
  block). Watch over a longer window before tuning — only ~2 min of posture data so far.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [draft-coded] — **HC-team top-up pass (the real dribble fix), drafted.** With ~4h of B58
  data the dribble is CONFIRMED, not warm-up: `unitsPerTeam` ran 4.9–9.6 (mostly 6–7) all round while
  founding kept firing (founded 5→49, HC registered 4–11-unit teams). Root cause stands at
  `AI_Commander_Produce.sqf:63` — refill is gated `!(team getVariable "wfbe_aicom_hc")`, so 100% of live
  teams never refill. Produce *can't* fix it: `AIBuyUnit` spawns the refill at a SERVER factory, but HC
  teams are local on the HC, so the top-up must be created HC-side and `join`ed there (the locality rule
  `Common_RunCommanderTeam.sqf`/`Common_CreateTeam.sqf` rely on). Draft committed:
  `Server/AI/Commander/AI_Commander_HCTopUp.DRAFT.sqf` — a server-side detector that picks ONE
  under-strength HC team (below `0.6*SIZE_MIN`, NOT in contact, near a friendly supply town), charges
  funds, and routes an `aicom-team-topup` request over the existing RequestSpecial/HandleSpecial bus.
  **NOT WIRED / default-OFF** behind `WFBE_C_AICOM_HC_TOPUP_ENABLE` (absent ⇒ false ⇒ early exit), referenced
  by no loader ⇒ zero live impact. A2-OA-safe (typeName guard, no sim/distance-gating of the team — it only
  ADDS units, never stops one; no antistack touch). The file's footer specifies the HC-side consumer to
  write next (createUnit near leader + joinSilent). Throttled 1 team/call to avoid a town-activation spike.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **EAST spearhead is frozen on a far town the whole B58 round.** Impressions
  show EAST spearhead locked on **Berezino, distFront=1752**, onFront=true, for the entire round — EAST
  stayed DEFEND and barely captured, while WEST cycled `Myshkino→Pustoshka→Vybor` (distFront ~1200–1440)
  and pressed to 3 towns. The spearhead selector ranks by distance-to-own-front (dominant) yet EAST never
  re-picks the nearer reachable town. Proposal: in `AI_Commander_Strategy.sqf` spearhead block, when a
  side's chosen spearhead `distFront` does not shrink for N consecutive ticks, force a re-pick of the
  **nearest reachable** enemy/neutral town (the contiguity/reach fallback already exists in
  `AI_Commander_AssignTowns.sqf:254-345` — lift the same nearest-reachable rule into the spearhead picker).
  A2-OA-safe (selection logic only, no gating).

- 2026-06-20 20:00 [draft-coded] — **`unitsPerTeam` is a BLENDED metric — the "below floor" alarm is partly an artifact.**
  12h RPT (B58, one continuous round) DEFINITIVELY confirms the founding-pad fires: **19× `B57 padded
  infantry team to found-size (10 units)`**, and the founding-size distribution is **76% at 8+, 16 teams at
  10+, avg 8.59** (`AI_Commander_Teams.sqf:298-306`). Infantry founds BIG. The live `unitsPerTeam` still
  reads ~6.3 (WEST)/7.3 (EAST) because the average BLENDS 10-man padded infantry with **8 teams that found at
  exactly 4 units** — these are vehicle/armour crews the pad correctly skips (`_isBigVeh`, Teams.sqf:294-297).
  So the headline "below floor" from the 4h/8h reports is partly a **measurement artifact**, not a founding
  failure. Draft committed: CMDRSTAT now emits an additive **`infPerTeam`/`vehPerTeam`/`infTeams`/`vehTeams`**
  split (`AI_Commander.sqf:351-396`), keeping `unitsPerTeam=` intact so the soak parser stays compatible.
  Pure diag_log, behaviour-neutral, A2-OA-safe (`isKindOf`/`getNumber`/`count` only; no sim/distance-gating;
  no antistack). Next round will show whether the *infantry* average alone is genuinely dribbling (→ promote
  the HC top-up) or holding near 10 (→ stand down the alarm).
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Recurring WEST assault-stranding the unstuck/abandon ladder is NOT resolving.**
  12h RPT: **21× `ASSAULT_STRANDED`, ALL WEST** (zero EAST), recurring on the SAME teams (`B 1-3-G`, `B 1-3-A`,
  `B 1-2-M`) toward Kabanino/Stary Sobor, `moved=0 stuck=true elapsed≈482` each time — e.g.
  `ASSAULT_STRANDED|team=B 1-3-G|town=Kabanino|dist=1753|elapsed=483|moved=0|stuck=true`. Meanwhile the side
  fired **156 `UNSTUCK_STRIKE` + 700 retreat-and-reform** and STILL the same teams re-strand. The
  TARGET_ABANDON blacklist exists (`AI_Commander_AssignTowns.sqf:202-219`, fires after
  `WFBE_C_AICOM_STUCK_ABANDON=4` strikes, cooldown 600s) but the dist=1753–4420 mounted long-legs suggest the
  team's **vehicle is wedged** (moved=0) faster than the strike counter on the assign-towns tick accumulates,
  OR the team blacklists Kabanino, waits out the 600s cooldown, then re-picks the same nearest spearhead and
  re-grinds. Proposal: feed `ASSAULT_STRANDED` (moved≈0 over the ~482s window) DIRECTLY into the strike
  counter so a genuinely-immobile team trips TARGET_ABANDON regardless of re-issue cadence; and on the Nth
  strand of the SAME (team,town) pair, lengthen that pair's cooldown (escalating, not flat 600s) so it stops
  cycling back. A2-OA-safe (selection/counter logic only, never freezes a team — abandon always re-targets).
  **NOT drafted in-code** this cycle: the unstuck path is delicate (a wrong touch risks a frozen/standing AI,
  which is forbidden) — investigate the stranded↔strike coupling with Ray before drafting.

- 2026-06-21 00:15 [draft-coded] — **THE FRONT FROZE — dominant-but-passive stall, root-caused + diagnostic drafted.**
  16h read (B58 ticks 13→28, ~20:00→00:00): **captures flatlined at WASPSTAT=7 for ~5.5h** (tick 17 onward) and
  BOTH sides sat in **DEFEND** the entire back half despite WEST holding **6 towns vs EAST 1**. Root cause found in
  `AI_Commander_Strategy.sqf:380-384`: PRESS is gated `_myTowns >= enTowns*1.2 && {_myStr >= _enStr}`, and DEFEND
  triggers outright on `_myStr < _enStr`. WEST's maneuver strength ran **61–77 vs EAST 77–90** the whole back half —
  i.e. the *territorial leader had the LOWER army strength* because it garrisons 6 towns while EAST concentrates in 1.
  So WEST trips `_myStr < _enStr → DEFEND` and never PRESSes; EAST has fewer towns so it also DEFENDs → mutual freeze.
  **Caveat:** that posture block is *telemetry-only* (it logs, it doesn't drive dispatch), so the behavioural fix lives
  in the real target/assault path, not here. Drafted THIS cycle (additive, behaviour-neutral): a **STALL diag** emitted
  whenever a side holds ≥2× the enemy's towns yet isn't PRESSing (`AI_Commander_Strategy.sqf`, after the FRONT line) so
  the freeze is greppable next round. A2-OA-safe: pure `diag_log`, no sim/distance-gating, no antistack.
  **Real fix (idea, NOT coded):** split strength into *garrison* vs *maneuver* and gate PRESS on maneuver mass only, OR
  weight aggression by town-dominance so a 6:1 leader presses even at slightly-lower total strength. Review with Ray.
- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **EAST spearhead STILL frozen on Berezino (distFront=1752) — now confirmed across the whole
  overnight run.** Every tick 13→28 shows `EAST spearhead=Berezino distFront=1752 onFront=true` unchanged; EAST never
  re-picks a nearer reachable town and never advances. This is the same frozen-spearhead bug filed at 8h, now with a
  full-night of evidence — promote the "re-pick nearest-reachable when distFront doesn't shrink for N ticks" fix
  (`AI_Commander_Strategy.sqf` spearhead block, lifting the reach rule from `AI_Commander_AssignTowns.sqf:254-345`).

## AI unit improvements
<!-- per-unit/per-group behaviour: pathing, unstuck, garrison, engagement, rearm/heal detours. -->

- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Founded teams attrit with no in-field healing/rearm detour.** Since teams
  are never refilled, keeping the units they *have* alive matters more. Proposal: a lightweight per-team
  "self-preserve" — when a team is below strength, not in active contact, and a medic/ammo source (own
  vehicle/depot) is in range, allow a brief heal/rearm detour before resuming the assault. Must
  re-wake/return to offense on enemy proximity (never a standing-still AI) and not gate on simulation.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Town-capture grind guard already exists** (STUCK_ABANDON blacklist,
  `Init_CommonConstants.sqf:236-239`) — confirm over the soak it actually fires and teams re-pick rather
  than grinding an unflippable town. RPT showed healthy re-pick at warm-up (`town:Dubrovka;detected:12`),
  but verify on a contested stalemate town later in the run.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **Stalemate-town blacklist: live test case now exists.** EAST sat on Berezino
  the entire B58 round without flipping it. Confirm `STUCK_ABANDON`/`TARGET_ABANDON`
  (`AI_Commander_AssignTowns.sqf:163-231`) actually fires on this town and EAST re-picks a flippable one,
  rather than grinding it indefinitely. If it never abandoned Berezino over hours, the abandon threshold
  is too lax for the spearhead path — tighten it or feed the abandon back into the spearhead selector.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **In-field heal/rearm matters MORE now that the dribble is confirmed.** Until
  the top-up pass lands, keeping the units a team already has alive is the only lever on live `unitsPerTeam`.
  Lightweight per-team self-preserve (heal/rearm detour when below strength, not in contact, near own
  vehicle/depot) — must re-wake to offense on enemy proximity (never a standing-still AI) and not sim-gate.
  Pairs with the top-up pass (top-up replaces the dead; heal/rearm slows the dying).

- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Unstuck ladder fires hard but can't free the *recurring* stranded teams.**
  At 4h the ladder looked great (39 strikes, all recovered). At 12h it is at **156 `UNSTUCK_STRIKE` + 700
  retreat-and-reform** yet the SAME WEST teams (`B 1-3-G`, `B 1-3-A`) re-strand with `moved=0` at the same
  towns — the Tier1→3 ladder (`Common_RunCommanderTeam.sqf:449-475` / executor `wfbe_aicom_unstuck`) recovers
  transient stucks but not these persistent ones. Hypothesis: it's the team's **vehicle** that is wedged on
  terrain (these are mounted long-legs, dist 1753–4420). Proposal: after N unstuck strikes on a team that
  still reports `moved≈0`, **force-dismount** (crew leaves the wedged vehicle and continues to the objective
  on foot) instead of re-nudging the hull forever. A2-OA-safe (`moveOut`/`leaveVehicle`/`orderGetIn false`,
  all 1.64) and never freezes AI — they immediately continue toward the town on foot. Verify it doesn't
  strand them worse far from target before drafting; pairs with the AICOM stranded→abandon coupling above.

## Functions: working / broken
<!-- which mission functions / features are confirmed WORKING vs BROKEN this soak, with evidence. -->

### Working
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Server FPS: rock-solid.** SRVPERF held **46–49** across the whole young
  round, min 41 (one momentary warm-up dip), max 49, even as AI climbed to **349 units / 58 vehicles /
  5 active towns**. No degradation under load. Client-side Zwanon reported srvFps 45–48 (client fps 19 is
  a client number, not server).
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Larger-groups founding feature: confirmed operational.** Both sides reach
  `foundedTeams=10`; `CMDRSTAT` shows EAST `unitsPerTeam` 6.4–7.0, WEST 4.2–5.1; registered teams of
  7–10 units seen (`HC commander team ... registered (10 units)`); `remnants=0` both sides (clean
  wipe→refound lifecycle, no orphans). Founding pipeline healthy (dispatch→TEAM_FOUNDED→register, refills
  to target 10).
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **HC delegation healthy at the *team* level.** 2 HCs live, no drops this
  round, `delegated:7` each, `remnants=0`. Least-loaded picker (`Server_PickLeastLoadedHC.sqf`) +
  round-robin town spread (`Server_DelegateAITownHeadless.sqf`) working as designed.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **War progresses.** First flip `TOWN_FLIP town=Khelm GUER→EAST` (tick 31)
  ended EAST's bootstrap stipend; captures 0→2 in ~2 min; all three sides (WEST/EAST/GUER) actively
  engaging (kills logged WEST→GUER, EAST→GUER armor).
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Clean run, zero script errors** in the current round (see Bugs).
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **Server FPS held over the full ~4h window (B57→B58).** SRVPERF run:
  B57 `47→49→47`, B58 `45→46→48→43→42→38→43`; RPT scope (181 samples, B58 round) avg ≈44, min 23, max 49,
  **zero sub-20** even as live AI climbed 34→375 units / 68 veh / up to 8 active towns. Gentle decline
  tracks unit count, not a leak. No degradation = green.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **Unstuck ladder confirmed working at scale.** 39 `UNSTUCK_STRIKE` events,
  tiers escalating 1→3, every team recovered — no team left permanently stuck. The B37/WAVE-1 foot/dead-hull
  unstuck (`Common_RunCommanderTeam.sqf:449-475`) is doing its job over hours, not just at warm-up.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **Clean error budget over ~4h:** zero `Error in expression`, zero script
  errors, zero `Warning Message`. 10 teams/side both sides (`hcTeams=10 foundedTeams=10 remnants=0`).
  Founding pad fires (founded 5→49, registered 4–11 units). AICOM busy: ASSAULT 243, UPGRADE 110, TEAM 81,
  ECONOMY 72, WEDGE 15; AI peaked 446 units.

- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Founding-pad / larger-groups: CONFIRMED FIRING on B58 (corrects the record).**
  The 4h/8h impressions logged `padded=0 / sample=empty` and the feature was suspected dead. 12h RPT proves
  it WORKS: **19× `AI_Commander_Teams.sqf: [SIDE] B57 padded infantry team to found-size (10 units)`**, every
  pad to 10; founding distribution avg 8.59, 76% at 8+, 16 teams at 10+. The impressions `padded=0` is a
  **soak-parser bug** — the parser matches the old wording ("…to floor") but the live log says "…to
  **found-size**". Fix the harness match string (in `wasp-b57-soak`, outside this repo) so the feature stays
  visible; the feature itself is green. `foundedTeams=10` both sides, `remnants=0`, `srvTeams=0` (clean
  HC-only lifecycle).
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Server FPS still green at 12h.** SRVPERF flat **~43 (band 41–44)** across the
  whole window, **min 35** (single dip at peak 375 units), max 45, zero degradation/leak. Both HCs alive the
  whole window, **no drops**. HC fps mostly 44–48 with two transient single-tick dips (t=254 fps=36, t=342
  fps=18) that recovered next tick. The largest server hitches are **antistack** (`antistack_main ~361ms`,
  `antistack_flush ~353ms` in Performance-Audit) — hands-off per soak rules, logged for awareness only.
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Clean error budget at 12h.** Zero `Error in expression`, zero `Error position`,
  zero script errors, zero `Undefined variable`. Only engine noise = 2× cosmetic `Hitpoint Hitglass not found`
  on stock BIS building models (`housev_1i1_dam.p3d`, `mil_house_dam.p3d`) — not mission code. **Top error
  file+line: N/A — clean run.**

- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **Server FPS green for the full overnight (16h+).** SRVPERF across ticks 13→28 held
  **39–46** (band centre ~43), **min 35** at tick 15 (peak load 375 units / 108 groups / 70 veh), max 46 — same gentle
  unit-count tracking, no leak, no degradation. **Both HCs alive the entire window, ZERO drops, ZERO disconnects.**
  HC fps mostly 45–49 (earlier transient dip to 16 at tick 10 recovered). No crash / exception / OOM / access-violation
  markers anywhere in the round. One `WaspCleanRestart` RERUN fired back at ~12:17 (B57, procs 1/3) and recovered
  cleanly into B58 — stable since.
- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **Founding-pad now firing at SCALE and visible in impressions.** Tick 28 impressions read
  `padded=75 / sample=[WEST] B57 padded infantry team to found-size (10 units)` — the larger-group feature is confirmed
  firing en masse, and the soak-parser match (the "to found-size" vs "to floor" gap flagged at 12h) is now catching it.
  `foundedTeams=10` both sides every tick, `remnants=0`, `srvTeams=0` — clean HC-only lifecycle held all night.
- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **Town-AI delegation to 2 HCs held perfectly.** Every Performance-Audit shows
  `delegated == groups` (e.g. `groups:7;delegated:7;headless:2`), AVG_MS mostly 0–2ms with occasional 19–31ms
  town-spawn spikes. 749 `ASSAULT_DISPATCH` over the round — AICOM is busy, not idle.

### Broken
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **#1 behavioural bug at 12h: recurring WEST assault-stranding.** 21
  `ASSAULT_STRANDED` (all WEST, same teams, `moved=0`), 156 unstuck-strikes + 700 retreat-reforms NOT freeing
  them. Full detail + proposal under *AI Commander improvements* and *AI unit improvements*. Front grinds on
  the WEST side even though WEST is winning on holdings.
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Soak-parser blind to the founding-pad (CONFIRMED, visibility-only).** Pad fires
  19× to 10 units but impressions reads `padded=0` — parser matches "to floor" not the live "to found-size".
  Harness fix (outside this repo). The feature is NOT broken; the *metric* is.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **HC *unit-load* imbalance (watch, not yet confirmed-bug).** `HCDELEG ...
  perHC=7:196,7:0`, `imbalance=-1`: even team count (7:7) but one HC holds ~196 units while the other
  holds ~0; `HCSTAT HC-2:58 units=1 groups=0` (near-idle). Most likely **warm-up** (HC-2 registered late,
  hasn't accumulated), but if it persists it points at delegations routed to HC-2 whose units never
  materialise. The least-loaded picker is *team-agnostic and unit-accurate* by design, so it should
  self-correct — **re-check next report**; if `196:0` persists, investigate HC-2 spawn path.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **`unitsPerTeam` below the 8–12 floor** (4.2–5.1). Root-caused (no refill);
  draft + fix proposals filed under *AI Commander improvements*.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **`unitsPerTeam` < floor — CONFIRMED across the full B58 window** (4.9–9.6,
  mostly 6–7), not warm-up. Top-up draft now filed (`AI_Commander_HCTopUp.DRAFT.sqf`, default-OFF). Promote
  the wire-up + HC consumer in the AM.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **EAST spearhead frozen on Berezino** (distFront=1752 all round) — front never
  advanced on the EAST side; behavioural bug, fix filed under *AI Commander improvements*.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **HC-2 fps dips into the teens (min 14, 34 samples <25)** while server FPS
  holds. One HC (nodes :948/:979) carries the whole war; load looks concentrated (echoes the 4h-report
  `perHC=196:0`). Server never followed it down and there was NO HC drop, but the dips are the leading
  candidate for late-soak instability. Proposal: spread teams across HC nodes / add a second HC. Re-check
  whether the dips correlate with the highest unit-count ticks (impressions tick 10 showed HC fps 16 at
  units=375). **Re-confirm next report.**
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **Soak telemetry gap (visibility, not behaviour):** impressions logs
  `B58 founding: padded=0 / sample=empty` even though founding clearly fires (founded 5→49, 4–11-unit
  registrations). The soak parser's "padded" counter + sample string match the B57 log wording, not B58's.
  Fix the parser's match string so the larger-group feature stays visible in the next round's impressions.

- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **#1 NEW bug at 16h: ~20.8k "Message not sent" failures to BOTH HCs — and the soak harness
  is BLIND to it.** RPT current round: **10,413× `Message not sent - error 0, message ID = ffffffff, to 2087614107
  (HC)`** + **10,413× `... to 1774952748 (HC2)`** = ~20,826 lines, which started partway through the round and now hold
  steady at ~4,700–5,000 per 10k log lines (≈**50% of all log output** in the back half). The impressions accumulator
  reports `err=0 undef=0` because its counter only matches `Error in expression` / `Undefined variable` — it does NOT
  match this engine/network-layer class, so a log that is half-error reads as "clean". **Two actions:** (1) widen the
  soak parser to count `Message not sent` (and the `Object … not found (message N)` family) so this surfaces in
  impressions; (2) investigate the broadcast that's failing to reach both HCs — `error 0, ID=ffffffff` is a publicVariable
  /netobject send to a target the server thinks is gone or never registered. It is NOT a script error (zero of those)
  and FPS held ~43 through it, but 20k failed sends/round is a real signal — possibly a per-tick AICOM broadcast aimed
  at a stale HC handle. Pair with the HC-load concentration note below.
- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **505 stuck events overnight; the unstuck/abandon ladder works but a lot reach strike-5.**
  STUCKSTAT this round: 505 stuck, escalating strike1=129→strike5=86, with **371 `UNSTUCK_STRIKE` reissues + 86
  `TARGET_ABANDON`** (600s cooldown). The system IS resolving them (no permanent freeze), but 86 groups grinding to
  strike-5 before abandoning — last lines show pilots/crew stuck at distTgt 2700–3700 — is the same long-leg
  vehicle-wedge pattern as the 12h `ASSAULT_STRANDED` finding. The dismount-after-N-strikes idea (AI unit section)
  and the stranded→strike-counter coupling (AI Commander section) both target this. Minor co-noise: 408×
  `Object N:N not found (message 132)` + 190× client `Object not found` (benign net-sync races).

## Balance
<!-- economy, team comps, vehicle mix, town garrison strength, side parity, capture pacing. -->

- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **EAST out-strengthening WEST at warm-up** (str 101 vs 64; EAST `unitsPerTeam`
  6.4–7.0 vs WEST 4.2–5.1). EAST consistently drove the spearhead (Krasnostav→Berezino). Could be
  doctrine/template cost asymmetry (EAST founds bigger/cheaper) or just early variance. Track side-parity
  over the full run before tuning; if EAST persistently founds larger teams per supply, review per-side
  template costs / `WFBE_C_AICOM_TEAMS_PC_LOW` curve.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Found-size vs paced-economy interaction.** `SUPPLY_INCOME_MULT=0.35`
  throttles ongoing town income; bumping FOUND_SIZE 8→10 raises per-team cost ~25%. Net effect on team
  *count* vs team *size* is the balance lever to watch — decide with Ray whether bigger-fewer or
  smaller-more reads better in play.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **Capture pacing reads slow + side-asymmetric.** Only ~4 WASPSTAT flips in
  ~2.5h of B58; WEST pressed to 3 towns while EAST defended near-parity strength (~85 vs ~79). Part of the
  slow EAST side is the frozen-spearhead bug (above), but with the dribble dragging team strength below the
  band, neither side musters the mass to flip a defended town quickly. Expect the top-up pass + the EAST
  spearhead fix to both raise capture cadence — re-measure flips/hour after those land before touching
  garrison strength or drain rates.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **WEST consistently founds smaller teams than EAST** (WEST `unitsPerTeam`
  4.9–7.2 vs EAST 5.3–6.6, and WEST was the lower side at every B57 tick too). Persistent across two builds
  now — points at a per-side template cost/composition asymmetry rather than variance. Review WEST vs EAST
  template prices / the `PC_LOW` curve when tuning the founding economy.

- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **WEST near-shut-out of EAST at 12h, but WEST's own front is grinding.** Latest
  brief: WEST `towns=6 funds=2.42M teams=30 posture=spearhead` vs EAST `towns=1 funds=657k teams=28`. Captures
  visible in the tail = 2 (`Kabanino`, `NWAF`, both WEST-from-neutral) — cadence still slow. The twist vs the
  8h read (EAST frozen-spearhead): now it's **WEST** that holds the towns yet whose spearheads strand (all 21
  `ASSAULT_STRANDED` are WEST). So WEST wins on economy/holdings while bleeding momentum to terrain, and EAST
  can't capitalise. Don't tune garrison/drain until the stranding fix lands — re-measure flips/hour after.
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Do NOT tune the founding economy off blended `unitsPerTeam`.** Now that the
  metric is shown to blend 10-man infantry with 4-man vehicle crews (see AICOM draft), the inf/veh split must
  land first. Tuning per-side template prices or the `PC_LOW` curve off the blended 6.3/7.3 would over-correct.
  Read `infPerTeam` (the real attrition signal) next round before any economy change.

- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **The war stalemated, not because of parity but because the *winner* went passive.** WEST
  reached 6:1 towns by ~18:00 then captures FROZE for ~5.5h with both sides DEFEND (full detail under *AI Commander*).
  This is a *balance-shaped* problem too: holding towns saps maneuver strength (garrison drain) faster than the paced
  economy (`SUPPLY_INCOME_MULT=0.35`) can refund it, so a 6-town leader can't muster a pushing fist. The lever isn't
  garrison strength or drain — it's **decoupling "press" from total strength** (gate on maneuver mass, or give the
  territorial leader an aggression bonus). Do NOT raise income or garrison numbers to paper over it; that just inflates
  the stalemate. Re-measure flips/hour after the press-gate fix lands.
- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **HC load still looks concentrated (re-confirm target for the top-up + spread work).** The
  ~20.8k failed sends split EXACTLY evenly across both HCs (10,413 each), so both are addressed — but the earlier
  `perHC=196:0` unit-load skew + HC-2 fps dips remain the leading late-soak instability candidate. With both HCs proven
  to survive 16h+ here, this is now a *load-balance/tuning* item, not a stability emergency — fold it into the team-spread
  proposal rather than treating it as a fire.

## Player spectacle & cinematics (incl. AI-generated cinematics)
<!-- things that make the war feel alive for players to watch/join; ideas for AI-generated
     cinematics / highlight reels / camera work. -->

- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Town-flip "money shot" cam.** We already emit `TOWN_FLIP` events. On a flip,
  spin up a short auto-director camera over the captured town (orbit the flag/depot, cut to the nearest
  firefight) for spectators/JIP loading screen. A2-OA-safe with `camCreate`/`camSetTarget`/`cameraEffect`;
  trigger off the existing event so no polling.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Spearhead "front-line" spectator marker feed.** `CMDRSTAT`/spearhead logs
  already carry `onFront`, `distFront`, target town. Surface a live "current front: WEST→Pustoshka /
  EAST→Berezino" banner + map ping for spectators so the war reads at a glance. The B57 marker-dir fix
  (`updateteamsmarkers.sqf:202-218`) means leader arrows now point correctly — good base for a clean
  spectator map.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **AI-generated narrated recaps (out-of-game pipeline).** The RPT is a
  structured event stream (`AICOMSTAT|...|TOWN_FLIP`, `TEAM_FOUNDED`, `WASPSTAT KILL`, `CMDRSTAT` strength
  curves). Pipe each round's events to an LLM to auto-write a "battle report" recap (who pushed where, the
  turning-point flip, MVP kill streaks) and post it to Discord at round end. Zero in-game/server cost
  (pure log parse), and it makes the soak legible to people who weren't watching. Could later drive a
  highlight-reel cut-list (timestamps of the biggest flips/kills) for an automated camera pass.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Kill-streak / armor-duel highlight triggers.** `WASPSTAT KILL` lines already
  tag killer/victim/weapon/vehicle (e.g. `EAST→GUER ... T72_Gue`). Flag multi-kills and tank-vs-tank
  trades as candidate highlight timestamps for the recap/reel pipeline above.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **Auto-director spectator cam following the live front.** The spearhead/CMDRSTAT
  feed already names the current target town + `onFront`/`distFront` per side. A spectator/JIP-loading
  director cam could auto-cut to the live spearhead town, or to the highest unit-concentration firefight
  (pick the densest `nearEntities ["Man"]` cluster near the front), so anyone watching always sees the
  decisive action without manual camera work. A2-safe camCreate/camSetTarget/cameraEffect; data already
  emitted, so no new server polling.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **End-of-round AI battle-recap, concrete pipeline.** This round alone produced a
  clean structured stream (ASSAULT 243, TOWN flips, UPGRADE 110, CMDRSTAT strength curves, UNSTUCK ladder).
  Feed the per-round RPT slice to an LLM to auto-write a narrated recap — "WEST drove Myshkino→Vybor while
  EAST stalled at Berezino; turning point was flip #N; MVP duel was the T72 trade at HH:MM" — plus a
  highlight-reel cut-list (timestamps of the biggest flips/armor trades) for an automated camera pass.
  Zero in-game cost (pure log parse), and it makes a 24h soak legible to anyone who wasn't watching.

- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Animated front-line timelapse for the round recap.** The RPT carries every
  ownership transition: `WASPSTAT CAPTURE <town> <newSide> <oldSide>` (e.g. `CAPTURE Kabanino 2 0`),
  `TOWN_FLIP`, and `server_town_ai.sqf: Town [X] DEACTIVATED (inactivity, teams=N)`. Out-of-game, parse those
  into an **animated war-map** (town colours over time, front line sweeping) and post the GIF/MP4 with the
  end-of-round AI recap. Zero in-game/server cost (pure log parse, the data already exists). Pairs with the
  narrated recap already filed — the map is the visual, the LLM text is the voiceover.
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **"Hero/blooper team" beats for the recap.** The stranded/unstuck telemetry is
  inherently dramatic and already team-tagged: `B 1-3-G fought the terrain outside Kabanino for 8 minutes
  (156 unstuck attempts side-wide)`. Feed the per-team `ASSAULT_STRANDED`/`UNSTUCK_STRIKE` streaks to the LLM
  recap as colour ("the team that wouldn't quit" / "the wedged BMP of Stary Sobor"). Free narrative texture
  from logs we already emit; makes the AI war feel like it has characters.

- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **"Stalemate-breaker" auto-event for spectacle, driven by the new STALL flag.** The drafted
  `AICOMSTAT|...|STALL` line (this cycle) makes a frozen front machine-detectable. Out-of-game, a STALL that persists N
  ticks can trigger a scripted *spectacle beat* — e.g. an AI-narrated "the front has hardened at Stary Sobor; neither
  commander will blink" interstitial, or an in-engine cue to spin the auto-director cam onto the contested town so
  watchers see the deadlock as drama rather than a dead feed. The freeze that's a *bug* for the war is *tension* for the
  audience — surface it deliberately instead of hiding it.
- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **"Whole-night in 90 seconds" timelapse, now that we have a full overnight round.** This run
  is a clean 16h+ continuous round: 7 captures, a 6:1 sweep, a 5.5h deadlock, 749 assault dispatches, 505 stuck/recover
  beats. It's the perfect first input for the animated war-map timelapse + LLM voiceover pipeline already filed — the
  arc (rapid WEST sweep → grinding freeze) is genuinely a *story*. Recommend making THIS round the proof-of-concept for
  the end-of-round AI recap before the next soak. Pure log parse, zero server cost.
- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **Director-cam priority = the *contested* town, not the spearhead.** With the front frozen,
  "cut to the spearhead" shows two armies standing off at distFront=1752 doing nothing — boring. Better heuristic for the
  auto-director: rank candidate cam targets by **live combat density** (`count nearEntities [["Man"],500]` × recent KILL
  events near the town from `WASPSTAT`), so the camera always finds where bullets are actually flying even when the
  strategic map is static. A2-OA-safe (camCreate/camSetTarget + nearEntities; read-only on AI, no gating).

## Bugs found
<!-- script errors (Error in expression), broken markers, stuck teams, dropped HCs, etc.
     Include RPT evidence / file+line where known. -->

- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **No script errors in the current round.** RPT scan from the latest MISSINIT
  (line 64 of 2957) onward: **zero** `Error in expression`, zero `Error position`, zero `#0 file ... line`,
  zero `Undefined variable`, zero `Warning Message`. Top error file+line: **N/A — clean run.**
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **38× `Server error: Player without identity HC (id 464279660)` are
  PRE-MISSINIT residue** (all appear *above* line 64), i.e. leftover from the *previous* round's HC
  reconnect/shutdown churn — **not** the current round. No occurrences after MISSINIT. Not a current bug,
  but worth confirming HC identity is clean on the next restart.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **Soak-coverage caveat (process note).** This RPT only covers a freshly
  started round (≈tick 38, daytime 9.50→9.65 — tens of minutes, not 24h). impressions.md has only 2 ticks
  (~2 min). The server appears to have **restarted recently**; long-duration soak data (FPS drift over
  hours, late-game economy, HC stability over time) is **not yet present**. Treat all FPS/parity/imbalance
  reads above as warm-up snapshots; re-confirm trends in the next 4h report.
- 2026-06-20 11:55 [idea] — **HC unit-load imbalance (`perHC=7:196,7:0`)** logged here too for bug-triage
  visibility — see *Functions → Broken* for detail. Re-check next report; warm-up vs real-bug undecided.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **Still ZERO script errors over ~4h.** RPT scope from the latest MISSINIT
  (B58, line 168) onward: 0 `Error in expression`, 0 `Error position`, 0 `#file line` offenders, 0
  `Undefined variable`, 0 `Warning Message`. **Top error file+line: N/A — clean run.**
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **One rerun fired ~12:17** (`RERUN via WaspCleanRestart — reason: server down,
  procs=1/3`) during the B57 round; B58 then shipped 13:08 at 3/3. Rerun-on-restart handled it cleanly and
  the soak continued, but a server/HC proc dropped once — worth confirming *why* (the prior 38× pre-MISSINIT
  `Player without identity HC` residue suggests HC reconnect churn around restarts). Not a current-round bug.
- 2026-06-20 15:50 [idea] — **Cosmetic-only RPT noise (not bugs):** missing RU voice file ×2
  (`Cannot load sound ...havethetargetinmysights.wss`), 168 benign engine `Object NN not found (message)`
  net-syncs (objects deleted while a remote message was in flight — normal), and a one-shot
  `cleaner_droppeditems 5517ms` cold-start hitch at round init (fired once, server FPS held). No action
  needed beyond optionally shipping the RU .wss.
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Recurring WEST `ASSAULT_STRANDED` — top bug at 12h.** 21 events, all WEST, same
  teams, `moved=0 stuck=true elapsed≈482`. RPT evidence:
  `AICOMSTAT|v2|EVENT|WEST|257|ASSAULT_STRANDED|team=B 1-3-G|town=Kabanino|dist=1753|elapsed=483|moved=0|stuck=true`
  (and `B 1-3-A`/`B 1-2-M` at Kabanino/Stary Sobor). 156 `UNSTUCK_STRIKE` + 700 retreat-and-reform fired
  side-wide but the SAME teams re-strand → the unstuck/abandon ladder is not resolving persistent
  (likely vehicle-wedged) stucks. Fix proposals filed under *AI Commander* + *AI unit improvements*. Not a
  script error (zero of those) — a behavioural/pathing bug.
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **antistack is the biggest server hitch source (AWARENESS ONLY — hands-off).**
  Performance-Audit peaks: `antistack_main ~361ms`, `antistack_flush ~353ms`, dwarfing everything else
  (`cleaner_craters ~145ms`, `delegate_townai_headless ~76ms`, `createunit ~55ms avg / 69ms max` during
  mass-spawns). Per soak rules antistack is NOT to be touched — logged so Ray has the number. Server FPS held
  ~43 through these hitches, so no action; just visibility.
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Town-AI `DEACTIVATED` volume high (73), incl. one owned WEST town with 9 teams.**
  Mostly GUER (`server_town_ai.sqf: Town [Berezino] DEACTIVATED for [GUER] (inactivity, teams=6)`), but one
  WEST: `Town [Vybor] DEACTIVATED for [WEST] (inactivity, teams=9)`. This is the town-AI sleeping an inactive
  town — expected — but confirm a deactivated OWNED town **re-wakes its garrison on player/enemy proximity**
  (no-frozen-AI rule) and doesn't leave a 9-team hole an enemy can walk into uncontested. Likely
  working-as-designed; flagged for a proximity-rewake spot-check.
- 2026-06-20 20:00 [idea] — **Still ZERO `Error in expression` / script errors at 12h.** Only engine messages
  are 2× cosmetic `Hitpoint Hitglass not found` on stock BIS building models — not mission code. **Top error
  file+line: N/A — clean run.** No dropped HCs, no disconnects, no JIP errors in the current round.

- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **STILL zero SQF script errors at 16h, BUT the log is now ~50% engine "Message not sent"
  noise.** Confirmed again: 0 `Error in expression`, 0 `Error position`, 0 `Undefined variable`, 0 `#file line`
  offenders — the mission code is clean. The headline of the round is the **~20,826 `Message not sent - error 0,
  message ID = ffffffff, to <HC>/<HC2>`** failures (10,413 each) detailed under *Functions → Broken*. **Top error
  file+line: still N/A (no script error carries one)** — this class is engine/network-layer, not script. Action filed:
  widen the soak parser to count it (so `err=` stops reading 0 on a half-error log) + investigate the failing HC
  broadcast. No dropped HCs, no disconnects, no crash markers — the server is healthy, the *log* is noisy.
- 2026-06-21 00:15 [idea] — **Soak-progress note (freshness caveat).** RPT round-tick reached **t=663**, slightly ahead
  of impressions' last logged tick (t=648 @ tick 28, 23:48) — consistent with a live, continuing round. One oddity to
  confirm with Ray: the RPT file's last-write mtime read as `2026-06-20 15:00:26` (a box clock/timezone skew vs the
  23:48 impressions tick), so double-check the server is still writing/running before the next 4h slice rather than
  trusting mtime. Round content itself is current (t advancing, FPS reports live).
