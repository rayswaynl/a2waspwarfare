# Agent Worklog

Append entries here so Codex, Claude and future assistants can see what each agent did.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex

- Created initial developer wiki structure and `docs/wiki` mirror plan.
- Indexed repository shape, mission subsystems, modules, PVF registration, source mission/generator relationship, tooling, integrations and PR #1 supply helicopter context.
- Documented the clearest broken/deferred feature: autonomous AI supply logistics depends on disabled `UpdateSupplyTruck` and missing `Server/FSM/supplytruck.fsm`.
- Added coordination files for Claude and future agents.
- Added machine-readable `agent-context.json`.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex Deep-Dive Pass 1

- Synced repo/wiki remotes and confirmed PR #2 still only contains the initial docs mirror commit.
- Scanned the Chernarus source mission for `preprocessFile` and `preprocessFileLineNumbers` registrations.
- Added `SQF-Code-Atlas.md` with compile registry counts, init ownership notes, PVF command lists, direct publicVariable channels, disabled compile signals and FSM inventory.
- Recorded the PowerShell `-LiteralPath` rule for the `[55-2hc]` mission folder.
- Added GitHub wiki `_Sidebar.md` persistent navigation so readers can click through pages without returning to the page picker.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex Coordination Pass

- Added `Claude-Long-Term-Goal.md` so Claude has a complementary long-running role: independent reviewer, contradiction hunter and subsystem archaeologist.
- Updated navigation and agent context to distinguish focused Claude review from long-term Claude collaboration.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex Wiki UX Pass

- Reworked `Home.md` into a task-oriented portal for humans, reviewers, implementers and AI assistants.
- Reworked `_Sidebar.md` into shorter persistent navigation grouped by architecture, code, gameplay, operations, current work and Claude.
- Added `_Footer.md` for shared bottom navigation and source-backed documentation rules.
- Added `Quickstart-For-Humans-And-Agents.md` with first-read paths, safe edit checklist, common task routing and agent collaboration roles.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex Background Reviewer

- Reviewed the repo read-only for missing docs before publish.
- Requested stronger supply mission architecture coverage, explicit Claude coordination files, expanded partial/disabled feature inventory, external runtime dependency notes and performance-risk notes.
- Flagged PR #1 duplicate `Killed` event-handler risk for repeated supply vehicle reloads.

## Claude

- Pending external Claude review.

## Future Agents

- Add dated entries here before and after substantial documentation or code changes.
