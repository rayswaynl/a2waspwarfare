# Progress Dashboard

This is the shared human + AI interface for seeing what Codex, Claude and Codex sub-agents are doing right now.

Keep this page open when parallel documentation work is running. It links to the live board, event feed and compact JSON status files without forcing readers through the whole sidebar.

## What this page is

- Shared source-of-truth for lane state, active owners and recently validated work.
- Human + AI handoff surface for current ownership and next action.
- Quick index for where to read next when a lane claims changes.

## Where this dashboard lives

- Wiki page: `docs/wiki/Progress-Dashboard.md`
- Runtime state files: `agent-status.json`, `agent-events.jsonl`, `agent-knowledge.jsonl`
- Coordination board: `Coordination-Board.md`
- Source of truth pointers: [`agent-context.json`](agent-context.json)

## How to use this page

1. Start with **At A Glance** to find active lanes and owners.
2. Read **Latest Batch** for the newest validated status update only.
3. Use **Current Lanes** to separate active docs work, watchlists and future code-owner work.
4. Use [Agent worklog](Agent-Worklog), [Discovery swarm](Subagent-Discovery-Swarm) and [`agent-events.jsonl`](agent-events.jsonl) for historic scout detail.

## Latest Batch

| Lane | Status | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto-wall-toggle-scope-branch-route` | Published / validated | Refreshed [Construction and CoIn](Construction-And-CoIn-Systems-Atlas) with a branch/root check: current source Chernarus, maintained Vanilla, stable `origin/master`, Miksuu upstream, `perf/quick-wins` and the feature-bundle release all keep `User14` toggling one global `isAutoWallConstructingEnabled` value consumed by later SmallSite/MediumSite construction. Condensed [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register), [Source fix propagation queue](Source-Fix-Propagation-Queue) and the machine ledgers. No gameplay source changed. |
| `visible-parameter-runtime-consumer-branch-route` | Published / validated | Refreshed [Mission parameters](Mission-Parameters-Localization-And-Generated-Build-Inputs) with a branch/root check: current source Chernarus, maintained Vanilla, stable `origin/master`, Miksuu upstream and the feature-bundle release all keep `WFBE_C_AI_MAX` visible/defaulted without an active maintained-root runtime reader, while `WFBE_C_UNITS_CLEAN_TIMEOUT` remains comment-only cleanup residue. Condensed [Dead/stale code](Dead-Code-And-Stale-Code-Register), [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register), [Source fix propagation queue](Source-Fix-Propagation-Queue) and [Player AI caps](Player-AI-Caps-And-Role-Balance). No gameplay source changed. |
| `buy-menu-price-key-branch-route` | Published / validated | Refreshed [Factory and purchase systems](Factory-And-Purchase-Systems-Atlas#buy-menu-price-and-driver-key-branch-matrix) with a branch/root matrix: current source, maintained Vanilla, stable and upstream still carry selected-detail price drift, stale `UNIT_COST_MODIFIER` reset behavior and the driver-default profile key split; release/QoL branch fix only Chernarus selected-detail price. Condensed [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register), [Client UI systems](Client-UI-Systems-Atlas), [BuyMenu EASA QoL audit](BuyMenu-EASA-QoL-Branch-Audit) and [Source fix propagation queue](Source-Fix-Propagation-Queue). No gameplay source changed. |
| `resistance-patrol-latch-branch-route` | Published / validated | Refreshed [Towns/camps/capture](Towns-Camps-And-Capture-Atlas#resistance-patrol-branch-matrix) with a branch/root matrix: current source Chernarus, maintained Vanilla, stable `origin/master` and Miksuu upstream still carry the `server_patrols.sqf` `||` latch hazard; `perf/quick-wins` and release Chernarus use `&&`, but maintained Vanilla still needs propagation. Condensed [AI runtime](AI-Runtime-HC-Loop-Map), [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register) and [Source fix propagation queue](Source-Fix-Propagation-Queue). No gameplay source changed. |
| `construction-smallsite-logic-branch-route` | Published / validated | Refreshed [Construction logic list cleanup](Construction-Logic-List-Cleanup) with a branch/root matrix: current source Chernarus, maintained Vanilla, stable `origin/master`, Miksuu upstream and the feature-bundle release all still carry SmallSite add/add while MediumSite removes `_nearLogic`. Condensed [Construction/CoIn atlas](Construction-And-CoIn-Systems-Atlas), [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register) and [Source fix propagation queue](Source-Fix-Propagation-Queue). No gameplay source changed. |
| `vehicle-cargo-loop-bounds-branch-route` | Published / validated | Refreshed [Vehicle cargo equip loop bounds](Vehicle-Cargo-Equip-Loop-Bounds) with a branch/root matrix: current source Chernarus, maintained Vanilla, stable `origin/master`, Miksuu upstream and the feature-bundle release all still carry the same five inclusive cargo loops in `Common_EquipVehicle.sqf` and `Common_EquipBackpack.sqf`. Added the compact [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register) row and condensed [Source fix propagation queue](Source-Fix-Propagation-Queue) plus [Gear/loadout/EASA atlas](Gear-Loadout-And-EASA-Atlas). No gameplay source changed. |

Older published batches are intentionally omitted from this table. Use [Agent worklog](Agent-Worklog), [Discovery swarm](Subagent-Discovery-Swarm), [`agent-status.json`](agent-status.json), [`agent-events.jsonl`](agent-events.jsonl) and git history for the long audit trail.

## At A Glance

| Actor | Status | Current lane | What to expect next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Active | `documentation-finisher-loop` | Keeping PR/release, upstream and backlog status pages current as branch heads and helper reports move. |
| FPS scout window | Returned / harvested | `old-be-current-wasp-fps-opportunity-scout-2` | Final report returned at `C:\Users\Steff\Documents\Codex\2026-06-05\wasp-old-mission-fps-opportunity-window\outputs\Old-BE-vs-Current-Wasp-FPS-Opportunity-Scout.md` and has been compacted into the old-BE, performance, testing and Feature Status owner pages. |
| Codex-2 | Ready | None | Pick a bounded source-backed lane from PVF dispatcher lookup, side-supply clamp first, commander reassignment call-shape repair or remaining supply authority hardening. |
| Claude | Autonomous-ready | `collaboration-follow-autonomous-ready` | Coverage Ledger navigation is wired. Claude can self-select the next bounded source-backed review from the ledger or hardening backlog. |
| Supported docs agents | First batch published / historical | `research-catchup-synthesis-default-supported`, `relevance-pruning-and-archive-default-supported` | Earlier account-default helper chats produced catch-up and pruning/archive work. Relaunch or resume only for a fresh narrow lane; they are not live dashboard blockers. |
| Read-only pruning scouts | Returned / harvested | `ui-runtime-bloat-scout`, `wiki-navigation-chain-scout` | UI/runtime lead is promoted; small navigation fixes are promoted; remaining archive-page caveat note is already satisfied by archive page headers. |
| Sub-agents | Returned / closed | `navigation-parity-and-scout-wave-2026-06-04` | Supports, UI, tooling and AI scouts returned; most findings confirmed existing owner pages. Economy scout was closed without output and is not evidence. |
| Shared docs | Live | GitHub wiki + docs mirror | Wiki and mirror should stay in parity after scoped validation; use event logs and git history for commit IDs. |

## Current Lanes

This table is only for active, autonomous-ready, watchlist or future owner lanes. Published documentation batches are recorded in **Latest Batch**, [Agent worklog](Agent-Worklog), [`agent-status.json`](agent-status.json), [`agent-events.jsonl`](agent-events.jsonl) and git history.

| Lane | Owner | Status | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `documentation-finisher-loop` | Codex | Active / ongoing | Use this dashboard, [Coordination board](Coordination-Board), [Wiki pruning ledger](Wiki-Pruning-And-Relevance-Ledger), [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register), [Pending owner decisions](Pending-Owner-Decisions), machine status files and fresh source evidence as the live open-task route. |
| `autonomous-claude-research` | Claude | Autonomous-ready | Self-select the next bounded source-backed review from [Codebase coverage ledger](Codebase-Coverage-Ledger) when Claude is active. |
| `feature-status-reconciliation` | Codex / future agent | Watchlist | Fold newly confirmed findings into [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register), owner pages and machine records. No untriaged finding is blocking this dashboard. |
| `implementation-hardening-from-backlog` | Future code owner | Owner decision / code lane | Pick implementation work from [`agent-hardening-backlog.jsonl`](agent-hardening-backlog.jsonl) only when Steff asks for gameplay patches or a code owner claims the work. |
| `testing-debugging-release-workflow` | Codex / future tester | Published release gate | Use [Testing workflow](Testing-Debugging-And-Release-Workflow) to distinguish source review, propagated source fixes and actual Arma smoke evidence. |
| `source-propagated-smoke-pending` | Future tester / release owner | Smoke pending | [Client skill init](Client-Skill-Init-Idempotency), [hosted FPS](Hosted-Server-FPS-Loop-Sleep), [supply scan](Supply-Mission-Scan-Narrowing), [paratrooper markers](Paratrooper-Marker-Revival) and [commander-built ARTY](Construction-And-CoIn-Systems-Atlas) are tracked in owner pages and Feature Status; they are not dashboard cleanup blockers. |
| `wasp-marker-wait-cleanup` | Future code owner | Source needs code | [WASP marker wait cleanup](WASP-Marker-Wait-Cleanup) remains a tiny patch-ready opportunity, not an active docs lane. |

## July Update To-Do

| # | Item | Dev branch | Scope | LOC estimate | Status | Validation gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Hosted Server FPS Loop Fix | `dev/july-update-hosted-server-fps-loop-fix` | Adopt/verify the DR-19 hosted/listen busy-spin fix for the July update target. Keep the low-risk early `!isDedicated` exit shape for FPS publisher loops; decide separately whether to consolidate the two FPS variables. | ~5-20 LOC for the loop guard; ~20-50 LOC if cleanup/consolidation is included. | Queued for July update. Remote dev branch created from `origin/master`. | Dedicated server still publishes `SERVER_FPS_GUI` / `WFBE_VAR_SERVER_FPS`; hosted/listen runs do not spin the FPS publisher loops; Chernarus and maintained Vanilla parity are named before release wording. |
| 2 | Takistan Airfield FPV Drone Bay | `dev/july-takistan-airfield-fpv-drone` | Add neutral captured-airfield objectives on Takistan. Use runway-edge capture placement plus a bunker/camp-gated Drone Bay near each hangar; unlock player-funded FPV drones with UAV/EASA progression, one active drone per player, side-wide cap, center-map boundary kill, no base sniping and AA/radar counterplay. Normal aircraft hangar use stays ungated. | ~350-700 LOC prototype; ~1000-1800 LOC for a July-quality server-authoritative Takistan-only version, plus `mission.sqm` object edits. | Queued for July update. Remote dev branch created from `origin/master`; design captured from Steff questionnaire. | Takistan boot/capture/JIP smoke; economy smoke for `$50` per player per cycle; UAV/EASA gate smoke; server-side ownership/funds/cap/tier/range rejection tests; base-protection and AA/radar counterplay smoke. |

## Recently Closed / Reclassified Open Items

- Camp flag texture branch scope: [Towns/camps/capture](Towns-Camps-And-Capture-Atlas), [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register) and [Source fix propagation queue](Source-Fix-Propagation-Queue) now distinguish current-source debt from the partial release-Chernarus `0a1e6165` capture fix; release Vanilla and repair-side world-flag refresh remain code-owner work.
- Coverage Ledger navigation request: [Home](Home), [`_Footer.md`](_Footer), [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) and [`agent-context.json`](agent-context.json) already linked it; [`_Sidebar.md`](_Sidebar) now links it too, and the Coordination Board mailbox is marked done.
- Dead-code OA compatibility scan refresh: [Dead/stale code register](Dead-Code-And-Stale-Code-Register) and `docs/analysis/dead-code-oa-compatibility-scan.json` now reflect the latest docs tree; the scan still reports `0` code-risk implementation hits.
- Final old-BE/current-Wasp FPS scout: `old-be-current-wasp-fps-opportunity-scout-2` returned and was harvested into [Old WarfareBE comparison](Old-WarfareBE-Performance-Comparison), [Performance sweep](Performance-Opportunity-Sweep), [Testing workflow](Testing-Debugging-And-Release-Workflow#full-server-fps-opportunity-pack) and [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register). It is no longer a live lane.
- Old FPS provenance cleanup: [Old WarfareBE comparison](Old-WarfareBE-Performance-Comparison) already routes current Wasp truth through source paths and [Current source status snapshot](Current-Source-Status-Snapshot); it is no longer a Latest Batch row.
- OA object-lifecycle command addendum: the old Codex-2 active claim is closed into [Arma 2 OA command version reference](Arma-2-OA-Command-Version-Reference#object-lifecycle-commands--oa-safe-locality-sensitive), covering `createVehicle`, `createUnit`, `deleteVehicle`, `hideObject` / `enableSimulation` and the A3-only `*Global` variants.
- Old BE/FPS helper windows are harvested and no longer live dashboard lanes. Their outputs route through [Old WarfareBE comparison](Old-WarfareBE-Performance-Comparison), [Player AI caps](Player-AI-Caps-And-Role-Balance), [Performance sweep](Performance-Opportunity-Sweep), [Testing workflow](Testing-Debugging-And-Release-Workflow#full-server-fps-opportunity-pack), [Feature status](Feature-Status-Register), [Agent worklog](Agent-Worklog) and [`agent-events.jsonl`](agent-events.jsonl).
- Old `ready-for-review` rows for PVF dispatch, victory/endgame and factory/purchase are no longer dashboard blockers. Their findings are published and integrated; next work is code-owner implementation or validation.
- Historic scout waves are closed, harvested or non-evidence until relaunched. Their detail belongs in [Discovery swarm](Subagent-Discovery-Swarm), [Agent worklog](Agent-Worklog) and [`agent-events.jsonl`](agent-events.jsonl), not in this live dashboard.
- Standing future work remains visible as watchlist/code-owner lanes instead of generic open dashboard spam.

## Recent Published Work

| Batch | Output | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI commander branch-head refresh | [AI commander audit](AI-Commander-Autonomy-Audit), [Current source snapshot](Current-Source-Status-Snapshot), [Quad AI Commander](Quad-AI-Commander) | Refreshed branch heads and kept branch/design evidence separate from shipped source. |

| Quad AI/support/lifecycle/UI/tooling scout harvest | [Quad AI Commander](Quad-AI-Commander), [Support specials](Support-Specials-And-Tactical-Modules-Atlas), [Tools/build](Tools-And-Build-Workflow) | Promoted source-backed non-duplicate deltas and left concept-only evidence clearly labeled. |
| Config/factory/UI/AI/cleanup/upstream scout harvest | [Mission config graph](Mission-Config-Version-Include-Graph), [Factory/purchase](Factory-And-Purchase-Systems-Atlas), [Client UI systems](Client-UI-Systems-Atlas) | Added version/runtime contract, latent `AIBuyUnit` wording, UI cleanup debt and loop-topology notes. |
| Town/respawn/upstream/performance scout harvest | [Gameplay systems](Gameplay-Systems-Atlas), [Respawn/death](Respawn-And-Death-Lifecycle-Atlas), [Performance sweep](Performance-Opportunity-Sweep) | Added respawn penalty, resource cap, capture reward and loop-topology refinements. |
| Commander vote/reassignment playbook | [Commander vote/reassignment](Commander-Vote-And-Reassignment-Playbook) | Routed commander UI/PV/authority pages through one patch-ready playbook. |
| Economy supply commander audit | [Economy authority first cut](Economy-Authority-First-Cut), [Supply authority cleanup](Supply-Mission-Authority-Cleanup-Playbook) | Completed source-backed economy/commander/supply boundary map and handed implementation choices to code owners. |

## Update Ritual

| Moment | Codex / Claude action | Human-visible result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starting work | Update `agent-collaboration.json` and append a `claim` event. | This dashboard and the coordination board show who owns what. |
| Still working after a long pass | Append a `heartbeat` event. | You can see that an agent is alive and where it is reading. |
| Finding a source-backed issue | Append a `finding` event and add a short worklog note. | The finding is visible before the full page is integrated. |
| Finishing a lane | Append a `complete` event, update affected pages and note validation status. | The lane moves from active to ready/integrated. |
| Handing off | Append a `handoff` event with the exact next action. | The next agent can pick it up without chat memory. |

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `active` | Someone is working this lane now. |
| `watchlist` | Keep synchronized when new evidence appears; no standalone action is currently blocked. |
| `owner decision / code lane` | Documentation is ready; a gameplay/release owner must choose or implement. |
| `published / validated` | Published into the wiki/docs set and reflected in navigation/context. |
| `blocked` | Needs user input, missing access or an external state change. |

## For Agents

1. Load [`agent-status.json`](agent-status.json), [`agent-collaboration.json`](agent-collaboration.json), [`agent-knowledge.jsonl`](agent-knowledge.jsonl), [`agent-events.jsonl`](agent-events.jsonl) and [Agent collaboration protocol](Agent-Collaboration-Protocol) before claiming work.
2. Treat `agent-events.jsonl` as append-only.
3. Keep claims bounded by source scope.
4. Never overwrite another agent's page or navigation changes from a stale branch.
5. Publish human notes to [Agent worklog](Agent-Worklog) and machine notes to the JSON files.
